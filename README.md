## Why this example

The above example program generates a 2048 bit RSA Key pair. It also generates the p,q,n,e and d sections into the text file. In order to build this sample using Visual C++, you will need to build OpenSSL first. After you build OpenSSL, you can then include the generated headers to your VC/Include folder. You will also need to include the the lib files generated by OpenSSL onto VC/Lib. The above example program is written in VS05. OpenSSL simply rocks!
