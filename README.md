# RSAKeyPair
Generating RSA Key Pair Programmatically using OpenSSL
This is a boilerplate to generate the RSA Key Pair programmatically using Open SSL

## Why this example

The above example program generates a 2048 bit RSA Key pair. It also generates the p,q,n,e and d sections into the text file. In order to build this sample using Visual C++, you will need to build OpenSSL first. After you build OpenSSL, you can then include the generated headers to your VC/Include folder. You will also need to include the the lib files generated by OpenSSL onto VC/Lib. The above example program is written in VS05. OpenSSL simply rocks!

## How to
- [Copy]
  - [openssl]copy the 'openssl' directory to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\include
  - [libeay32]copy libeay32.lib,ssleay32.lib,ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\lib
- [Reference]Reference your lib files in you project
  - [libeay32]Right click on your project > select properties >Linker >Input > Additional Dependencies> Add ssleay32.lib and libeay32.lib by clicking the ... button.
  - Copy the dll's ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll to your project folder (where your vc++ project or solution file resides)
- [Rebuild] Rebuild the solution. and run. (fingers crossed, it should work smoothly).
